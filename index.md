##SpaceAPPS Create: Virtual planetary exploration - AquaSeeker 

=============================================================

### Who are we?

<img src="Black and Red Gaming Logo.png" alt="" class="center" width="50" height="50"/>

We are a team of mechatronics engineers that always had dreamed with "The far far away", honing our skills every day hoping to help space exploration one day 
and working to empower space and interplanetary exploration.

### Which is our north?
We believe that robotics can help a lot in exploration providing value by boosting data collection and exploration in general, in this case, mars exploration. Putting cobots on the mars surface in order to cover faster the necessity of acquiring knowledge of our friendly neighbor.

### In what we are good?
Our team covers different areas, just like electronics, mechanics, physics, generative design, artificial intelligence, embedded systems, 3d printing, and robotics.

Even tho, we had done several personal projects about aerospace and aerodynamic design.

### Cientific and technical process 

### Modelo 3D
### Videos de interacción con el modelo 3d
### Posible impacto en la misión de Marte
### Cierre y video
