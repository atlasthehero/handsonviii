### Who are we?

<img src="Black and Red Gaming Logo.png" alt="" class="center" width="300" height="300"/>

We are a team of mechatronics engineers that always had dreamed with "The far far away", honing our skills every day hoping to help space exploration one day 
and working to empower space and interplanetary exploration.

Am... Hands ON VIII? Yes! it was the name of a series of robotics and project management courses that we had in college, that we thought it ended in Hands ON VII but... Voilá

### Which is our north?
We believe that robotics can help a lot in exploration providing value by boosting data collection and exploration in general, in this case, mars exploration. Putting cobots on the mars surface in order to cover faster the necessity of acquiring knowledge of our friendly neighbor.

### What we are good in?
Our team covers different areas, just like electronics, mechanics, physics, generative design, artificial intelligence, embedded systems, 3d printing, and robotics.

Even tho, we had done several personal projects about aerospace and aerodynamic design.

### Cientific and technical process 

At first, we identify the most important variables that humans are looking for in the exploration of Mars. To do this, we base ourselves on the 4 scientific objectives that the Mars Exploration Program has as its principle:

These include those related to the search for biosignatures and caching samples, as they are those that come into action when linking them with engineering applications that facilitate such processes, like the implementation of a device or artifact capable of complying with these challenges.

In order to make our autonomous system essentially useful for the mission, we identified all the instruments mounted on the Rover Perseverance, each with unique functions (which can even include several transducers and among other maneuverability devices, as is the case of the turret or robotic arm), in order to determine which of these could be distributed throughout the area in various autonomous units, in a way that allows to collect more valuable information in the shortest possible time, while allowing to increase the range of possibilities in which some data of great impact for the scientific community can be observed and captured. []

To choose this instrument, we are based on some criteria related to the importance that this instrument brings within the objectives, weight and energy consumption. This categorization is based on the need to have a reduced body volume of each autonomous unit, which brings with it a low energy consumption inherent to the reduced load capacity. The following table contains specific information from the various instruments regarding the criteria mentioned above:

As soon as we set the goal, we began to brainstorm possible solutions involving the RIMFAX module to find water on Mars. From this process we conclude that this task must be carried out efficiently and quickly, since finding water on Mars would exponentially accelerate the colonization of that planet. By priority, we propose a swarm of autonomous collaborative robots, capable of exploring the entire surface of Mars.

These robots would have the following elements for Martian exploration:

-	The robot body will be made of rugged materials to protect the electronics inside and will have heaters to keep all electronic components in proper operation.
-	Central processing unit where all decisions will be made.
-	Temperature sensor to transmit its value to the CPU and this control the heaters.
-	Battery level sensor
-	Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to identify and control the robot's imbalance and prevent the robot from overturning.
-	For navigation we will implement a LIDAR.
-	For power generation we will implement solar panels.
-	Its traction system will be using mecanum wheels with electric motors directly connected to these wheels, thus avoiding a steering system.
-	Antennas to communicate with satellites to report their status, and their location in case of finding groundwater.

These robots would reach the Martian surface through a similar capsule in which astronauts from the Apollo 11 mission arrived. When you opened the gate, they would go out in different directions in search of water sources.
